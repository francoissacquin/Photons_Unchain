# Photons_Unchain
A one week project with Sarah TALON SAMPIERI, Tanguy CHOTEL and myself on biological and electronical light sensors.
For this project, we focused on a microscopic organism called Daphnia. This little water creature is capable of positive and negative phototaxis meaning it can be drawn to, or escape from, a light source depending on its intensity and wavelenght.
